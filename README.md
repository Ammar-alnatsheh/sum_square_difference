# sum_square_difference
this code should return the difference between the sum of the squares of a given number and its square of the sum
example:
        The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
        
        The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
        
the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
